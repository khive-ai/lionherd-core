    "# Tutorial: Database Connection Pool with Leak Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: Concurrency\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Advanced\n",
    "**Time**: 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Database connection pools are critical infrastructure in production applications, but connection leaks are among the most common—and difficult to debug—production issues. When connections aren't properly returned to the pool, the pool exhausts, causing cascading failures across your application. Traditional approaches only discover the problem when it's too late: when your application starts timing out on database operations because the pool is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge isn't just implementing a connection pool with acquire/release semantics—it's building observability into the pool to detect leaks **before** they cause outages. You need to track which connections are live, how long they've been held, and automatically detect when connections are garbage collected without being properly released (indicating a leak in application code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **Resource Exhaustion**: Leaked connections cause pool exhaustion, leading to cascading failures across all database operations\n",
    "- **Production Debugging**: Connection leaks are notoriously hard to debug—by the time you see symptoms, root cause is long gone\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: Without leak detection, you only know about the problem when your application is already down\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A production-ready connection pool using lionherd-core's `LeakTracker` that automatically detects connection leaks, provides detailed leak reports, and integrates with application lifecycle for graceful shutdown."

    "\n",
    "We'll implement a production-grade connection pool with integrated leak detection using lionherd-core's resource tracking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Abstraction**: Mock database connection with realistic lifecycle (open, close, query)\n",
    "2. **Pool Implementation**: Thread-safe connection pool with acquire/release semantics and size limits\n",
    "3. **Leak Detection Integration**: LeakTracker integration to monitor live connections and detect improper cleanup\n",
    "4. **Custom Reporting**: Rich leak reports showing connection age, pool statistics, and actionable diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lionherd-core Components**:\n",
    "- `LeakTracker`: Isolated tracker instance for pool-specific resource monitoring\n",
    "- `track_resource()` / `untrack_resource()`: Manual tracking for connection lifecycle integration\n",
    "- `LeakInfo`: Metadata access for custom reporting (name, kind, created_at)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Application → pool.acquire() → Connection + track_resource()\n",

    "           pool.release(conn) →    untrack_resource(conn)\n",
    "                    ↓\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Built production-grade connection pool with thread-safe acquire/release semantics\n",
    "- ✅ Integrated LeakTracker for automatic connection leak detection\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented background health monitoring with configurable alerting\n",
    "- ✅ Created rich leak reports with pool statistics and diagnostics\n",
    "- ✅ Learned configuration tuning for different production scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Leak detection isn't optional**: Connection leaks are common and devastating—build observability from day one\n",
    "2. **Context managers prevent leaks**: Automatic cleanup via `async with` eliminates the most common leak source\n",
    "3. **Monitor continuously, not at shutdown**: Detecting leaks during health checks prevents outages\n",
    "4. **LeakTracker uses weak references**: Automatic cleanup via finalizers makes tracking reliable without manual bookkeeping\n",
    "5. **Configuration matters**: Pool size, timeouts, and thresholds must be tuned to your workload characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Managing database connection pools\n",
    "- ✅ Any resource pool (HTTP clients, file handles, locks)\n",
    "- ✅ Production systems requiring high reliability\n",
    "- ❌ Single-connection use cases (overhead not justified)\n",
    "- ❌ Synchronous applications (async pool won't help)\n",
