    "# Tutorial: Service Lifecycle Management with TaskGroups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: Concurrency\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Advanced\n",
    "**Time**: 25-35 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Building production services often requires coordinating multiple components with complex dependencies. Consider an HTTP API service that needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A database connection pool that must be ready before anything else\n",
    "- A cache layer that depends on the database\n",
    "- An HTTP server that depends on both database and cache\n",
    "- Background workers processing tasks from a queue\n",
    "- A health monitoring system that checks all components\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge isn't just running these concurrently - it's managing their lifecycle: **initialization order**, **readiness signaling**, **health monitoring**, and **graceful shutdown**. If the database takes 2 seconds to connect, the API shouldn't start serving requests. If a component fails health checks, the service should shut down cleanly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches like spawning independent tasks lead to race conditions: the API starts before the database is ready, health checks run before components initialize, or shutdown leaves orphaned background workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **Correctness**: Components accessing uninitialized dependencies cause crashes or data corruption\n",
    "- **Observability**: Without coordinated health checks, you can't tell if the service is actually ready\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Uncoordinated shutdown leaves connections open, jobs incomplete, or resources leaked\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A production-ready service manager using lionherd-core's `create_task_group()`, `task_status.started()`, and Event coordination that manages multi-component initialization, dependency ordering, health monitoring, and graceful shutdown."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement a service manager using structured concurrency that handles the complete lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization Protocol**: Services signal readiness via `task_status.started()`\n",
    "2. **Dependency Ordering**: Parent waits for dependencies before starting dependents\n",
    "3. **Event Coordination**: Health checks use Events to signal between components\n",
    "4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Cancel scope triggers coordinated cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lionherd-core Components**:\n",
    "- `create_task_group()`: Structured concurrency context ensuring all tasks complete\n",
    "- `TaskGroup.start()`: Wait for service initialization\n",
    "- `TaskGroup.start_soon()`: Spawn background tasks\n",
    "- `Event`: Signal coordination between tasks\n",
    "- `cancel_scope`: Timeout and graceful shutdown\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Startup:\n",
    "  Database → started() → Cache → started() → API → started()\n",
    "                                    ↓\n",
    "                         Health Monitor (Events)\n",
    "                                    ↓\n",
    "                              Workers (Queue)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shutdown:\n",
    "  cancel_scope.cancel() → All tasks receive cancellation\n",
    "                       → Graceful cleanup in each\n",
    "                       → TaskGroup waits for all\n",
    "                       → Exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome**: Services start in correct order, health monitoring confirms readiness, shutdown is clean and coordinated."

    "## Variation: Parallel Service Initialization\n",

    "**When to Use**: Services have no dependencies and can initialize concurrently (faster startup)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def parallel_startup():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Start independent services in parallel.\"\"\"\n",
    "    async with create_task_group() as tg:\n",
    "        # All start concurrently\n",

    "        \n",
    "        # Wait for all\n",
    "        db_status = await db_task\n",

    "        # Now start dependent services\n",
    "        await tg.start(api_service, db_status, events_api)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs**:\n",
    "- ✅ Faster startup (services initialize concurrently)\n",
    "- ✅ Better resource utilization during initialization\n",
    "- ❌ More complex (need to track which services are independent)\n",
    "- ❌ Harder to debug (concurrent failures)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "- ✅ Built multi-component service manager with coordinated initialization\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented dependency ordering using `task_status.started()` protocol\n",
    "- ✅ Integrated health monitoring with Event-based coordination\n",
    "- ✅ Added background workers with queue-based task processing\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented graceful shutdown with cleanup protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "1. **Structured Concurrency**: TaskGroups ensure all tasks complete or cancel before exit - no orphaned tasks\n",
    "2. **Initialization Protocol**: `await tg.start()` + `task_status.started()` provides type-safe dependency ordering\n",
    "3. **Event Coordination**: Events signal between tasks without polling or sleep-based synchronization\n",
    "4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Cancellation propagates to all tasks, each handles cleanup in `except get_cancelled_exc_class()`\n",
    "5. **Production Readiness**: Error handling, monitoring, and configuration tuning are essential - not optional\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-component services with dependencies (HTTP API + database + cache)\n",
    "- ✅ Long-running services needing health monitoring\n",
    "- ✅ Background task processing with queues\n",
    "- ✅ Coordinated startup and shutdown requirements\n",
    "- ❌ Simple single-task operations (use asyncio.create_task instead)\n",
    "- ❌ Fire-and-forget tasks with no lifecycle management (use start_soon only)\n",
