    "# Tutorial: File Handle Tracking with Leak Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: Concurrency\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Intermediate\n",
    "**Time**: 20-25 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In production systems, file handles are finite OS-level resources. Every open file consumes a file descriptor from the process's limited pool (typically 256-4096 per process). When files aren't properly closed, your application gradually exhausts available file descriptors, leading to \"Too many open files\" errors that crash your service. Unlike memory leaks that degrade performance gradually, file descriptor exhaustion causes immediate, total failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is particularly insidious because:\n",
    "1. **Silent accumulation**: Files opened in error paths or forgotten in early returns leak silently\n",
    "2. **Delayed failure**: Issues often surface hours or days after deployment when descriptor count crosses the threshold\n",
    "3. **Hard to debug**: By the time you hit the limit, identifying which code path leaked handles is extremely difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **Service Reliability**: File descriptor exhaustion causes immediate application crashes, not graceful degradation\n",
    "- **Debugging Cost**: Tracking down handle leaks in production requires expensive heap dumps and service restarts\n",
    "- **Resource Limits**: Cloud containers often have stricter file descriptor limits (256-1024) than development machines\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A production-ready file handle tracking system using lionherd-core's `LeakTracker` that automatically detects unclosed files at program exit, reports leak details with timestamps, and integrates seamlessly with context managers for guaranteed cleanup."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement automatic file handle leak detection using lionherd-core's resource tracking combined with Python's `atexit` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Tracking**: Use `LeakTracker` to monitor all open file handles with metadata\n",
    "2. **Context Manager Protocol**: Implement `__enter__`/`__exit__` for guaranteed cleanup\n",
    "3. **Exit-Time Detection**: Register `atexit` handler to report unclosed files at program termination\n",
    "4. **Leak Reporting**: Generate detailed reports showing which files leaked and how long they were open\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lionherd-core Components**:\n",
    "- `LeakTracker`: Thread-safe resource tracker with weak references for automatic cleanup detection\n",
    "- `track_resource()`/`untrack_resource()`: Module-level functions for tracking individual resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Open File → track_resource() → Use File → __exit__() → untrack_resource() → Close\n",
    "                ↓                                           ↓                    ↓\n",
    "         Add to tracker                              Remove from tracker    Release FD\n",
    "                                                            |\n",
    "                                                    If forgotten:\n",
    "                                                            |\n",
    "                                                    atexit handler\n",
    "                                                            ↓\n",
    "                                                    Report leak with\n",
    "                                                    path, age, metadata\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome**: When files are properly closed via context managers, they're automatically untracked. If files leak (forgotten `close()` or early returns), the atexit handler detects them at program exit and reports detailed leak information."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "- ✅ Built a production-ready file handle tracking system with automatic leak detection\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented context manager protocol (`__enter__`/`__exit__`) for guaranteed cleanup\n",
    "- ✅ Integrated `atexit` handlers to detect and report leaked files at program termination\n",
    "- ✅ Used lionherd-core's `LeakTracker` for thread-safe resource tracking with weak references\n",
    "- ✅ Created comprehensive leak reports with grouping, statistics, and actionable recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "1. **File descriptors are finite**: OS limits (256-4096) make unclosed files a critical reliability issue, not just a performance problem\n",
    "2. **Context managers prevent leaks**: The `with` statement guarantees cleanup even during exceptions - always prefer it over manual `close()`\n",
    "3. **atexit provides last-line defense**: Exit-time leak detection catches bugs that slip through code review and testing\n",
    "4. **Tracking overhead is negligible**: ~10μs per file operation is irrelevant compared to file I/O costs (milliseconds)\n",
    "5. **Age-based reporting prioritizes fixes**: Oldest leaks (files open for hours/days) indicate systematic issues vs. recent bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "- ✅ Production services that open files for logging, configuration, data processing\n",
    "- ✅ Batch processing systems that handle many files per job\n",
    "- ✅ Development/testing environments to catch leaks early before production deployment\n",
    "- ✅ Services running in containers with strict resource limits (file descriptor limits often 256-1024)\n",
    "- ❌ Ultra-high-frequency I/O (>10,000 files/sec) - use sampling variation instead\n",
    "- ❌ Memory-mapped files or file-like objects (sockets, pipes) - require specialized tracking\n",
