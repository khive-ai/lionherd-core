    "# Tutorial: Deadline-Aware Task Queue Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: Concurrency\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Intermediate\n",
    "**Time**: 20-30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In production systems, you often need to process batches of tasks within a fixed time budget. For example, a background job that processes notifications, API rate-limited batch operations, or data synchronization tasks that must complete before a system maintenance window. The challenge is processing as many tasks as possible while respecting an absolute deadline - you can't just set a timeout per task, because the total time matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a notification service that needs to send emails before a daily cutoff time. You have 1000 queued notifications and 30 seconds until the deadline. Some notifications will take longer than others (external API calls, network latency), and you need to process as many as possible before time runs out. Simply processing each with a fixed timeout doesn't work - you might waste time on slow tasks early on, leaving faster tasks unprocessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **SLA Compliance**: Background jobs often have strict completion deadlines (ETL pipelines, report generation)\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Avoid wasting compute time on tasks that won't complete before deadlines\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: Return partial results rather than failing completely when time runs out\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A production-ready deadline-aware task queue processor using lionherd-core's `fail_at()` and `effective_deadline()` that processes tasks until the queue is empty or deadline is reached, with progress tracking and error recovery."

    "\n",
    "We'll implement a deadline-aware task processor that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deadline Management**: Uses absolute deadline (not per-task timeout) to control total execution time\n",
    "2. **Time-Aware Iteration**: Checks remaining time before processing each task\n",
    "3. **Progress Tracking**: Records successful/failed/skipped tasks\n",
    "4. **Graceful Degradation**: Returns partial results when deadline is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lionherd-core Components**:\n",
    "- `fail_at(deadline)`: Creates context that raises TimeoutError at absolute deadline\n",
    "- `move_on_at(deadline)`: Silent cancellation at deadline (for graceful degradation)\n",
    "- `effective_deadline()`: Query remaining time budget from ambient cancel scopes\n",
    "- `current_time()`: Monotonic clock for deadline calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flow**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input (queue, deadline) → Check deadline → Process task → Record result\n",
    "                              ↓                ↓              ↓\n",

   "source": "## Production Considerations\n\n**Error Handling**:\n- **Task timeout**: Add per-task timeout with nested `move_on_after()` to prevent indefinite hangs\n- **Cleanup timeout**: Wrap cleanup in `move_on_after(cleanup_timeout)` to enforce max time\n- **Callback errors**: Catch exceptions in error callbacks to prevent processor breakage\n\n**Performance**:\n- **Queue processing**: O(n) time, O(n) memory for results (consider streaming for >10k items)\n- **Deadline check**: ~0.1-0.5ms overhead per task (negligible for tasks >10ms)\n- **Benchmarks**: `current_time()` <1μs, `effective_deadline()` ~5-10μs, total <50μs/task\n\n**Testing**:\n```python\nasync def test_deadline_respected():\n    \"\"\"Verify processing stops at deadline.\"\"\"\n    tasks = deque([Task(id=f\"t-{i}\", work=lambda: sleep(0.1)) for i in range(100)])\n    deadline = current_time() + 1.0  # Only ~10 tasks fit\n    results, stats = await process_queue_with_deadline(tasks, deadline)\n    assert 8 <= stats.successful <= 12  # Within expected range\n    assert stats.deadline_reached is True\n```\n\n**Configuration Tuning**:\n- **deadline**: Recommended `1.2 × avg_task_duration × task_count` (20% buffer for variance)\n- **min_time_for_task**: Set to `0.1 × avg_task_duration` or 10ms minimum\n- **max_retries**: Use 2 for transient errors, 0 for validation errors"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "- ✅ Built deadline-aware task queue processor using `fail_at()` and `effective_deadline()`\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented progress tracking with comprehensive statistics\n",
    "- ✅ Added robust error handling with optional retry logic\n",
    "- ✅ Learned graceful degradation with partial results\n",
    "- ✅ Configured production-ready monitoring and tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "1. **Absolute deadlines** (`fail_at`, `move_on_at`) are better than per-task timeouts for batch processing with total time budgets\n",
    "2. **`move_on_at()` vs `fail_at()`**: Use silent cancellation for graceful degradation, error-raising for critical operations\n",
    "3. **Time-aware iteration**: Check remaining time before starting each task prevents wasted work on doomed tasks\n",
    "4. **Statistics are essential**: Without metrics, you can't tune deadlines or detect performance degradation\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "- ✅ Background jobs with strict completion deadlines (ETL, reports, batch notifications)\n",
    "- ✅ Rate-limited API operations where you want to maximize throughput within time budget\n",
    "- ✅ Maintenance windows with fixed time slots (pre-deploy tasks, data migrations)\n",
    "- ❌ Real-time processing where every task must complete (use per-task timeouts instead)\n",
    "- ❌ Tasks with hard dependencies (use DAG scheduler instead)\n",
