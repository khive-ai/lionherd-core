    "# Tutorial: Graceful Service Shutdown with Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category**: Concurrency\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Advanced\n",
    "**Time**: 20-30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Production services rarely run in isolation. A typical microservice might manage an HTTP API server, background workers, metrics exporters, database connections, and cache clients simultaneously. When shutdown occurs (deployment, scaling down, or crash recovery), you need all these services to terminate gracefully—completing in-flight requests, flushing metrics, closing connections—while preventing new work from starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge: cancellation signals (SIGTERM, SIGINT) don't distinguish between \"stop accepting work\" and \"abandon everything immediately.\" Without proper handling, you risk data loss, incomplete transactions, orphaned resources, and cascading failures in dependent services. Moreover, cleanup operations themselves can fail, and you need to distinguish between expected cancellations versus actual errors that require investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters**:\n",
    "- **Data Integrity**: Abrupt termination can leave databases in inconsistent states, lose queued messages, or corrupt files mid-write\n",
    "- **Observability**: If metrics exporters die before flushing, you lose visibility into what happened during the shutdown window\n",
    "- **Cascading Failures**: Downstream services waiting for responses will timeout and retry, amplifying the impact of a single service restart\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build**:\n",
    "A production-ready `ServiceManager` using lionherd-core's `TaskGroup`, `shield()`, and `non_cancel_subgroup()` that coordinates multiple concurrent services, handles OS signals gracefully, and ensures cleanup operations complete even when cancellation is requested."

    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement a multi-service manager using lionherd-core's concurrency primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TaskGroup**: Manages multiple services with structured concurrency—if any service fails critically, all services are cancelled together\n",
    "2. **Signal Handlers**: Capture SIGTERM/SIGINT and initiate graceful shutdown rather than abrupt process termination\n",
    "3. **shield()**: Protects cleanup operations from cancellation so they can complete even when shutdown is requested\n",
    "4. **non_cancel_subgroup()**: Filters exception groups to distinguish expected cancellations from unexpected errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lionherd-core Components**:\n",
    "- `create_task_group()`: Context manager for structured concurrency\n",
    "- `shield(func, *args, **kwargs)`: Run async function immune to outer cancellation\n",
    "- `non_cancel_subgroup(eg)`: Extract non-cancellation exceptions from exception group\n",
    "- `is_cancelled(exc)`: Check if exception is a cancellation\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Accomplished**:\n",
    "- ✅ Built a production-ready `ServiceManager` that coordinates multiple concurrent services\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented signal-based graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT) with two-phase termination\n",
    "- ✅ Used `shield()` to guarantee cleanup operations complete despite cancellation\n",
    "- ✅ Applied `non_cancel_subgroup()` to distinguish expected cancellations from real errors\n",
    "- ✅ Learned production considerations: timeouts, error handling, monitoring, configuration tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "1. **Structured concurrency (TaskGroup) prevents resource leaks**: All services stop together, no orphaned tasks\n",
    "2. **Two-phase shutdown (cooperative → forceful) minimizes data loss**: Give services time to drain gracefully before cancelling\n",
    "3. **shield() is essential for cleanup**: Without shielding, cleanup operations get cancelled mid-execution, leaving inconsistent state\n",
    "4. **Distinguish cancellations from errors**: `non_cancel_subgroup()` prevents false alarms—shutdown cancellations are expected, not errors\n",
    "5. **Timeout tuning is environment-specific**: Web services need 30-60s, batch jobs need 5+ minutes, stateless workers need <10s\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use This Pattern**:\n",
    "- ✅ Microservices managing multiple concurrent concerns (API, workers, metrics, health checks)\n",
    "- ✅ Long-running services that need graceful shutdown (databases, message queues, streaming processors)\n",
    "- ✅ Kubernetes/Docker deployments where SIGTERM is the shutdown signal\n",
    "- ✅ Services with stateful cleanup (flush buffers, close connections, persist checkpoints)\n",
    "- ❌ Short-lived CLI tools (unless they manage background tasks)\n",
    "- ❌ Pure compute workloads with no I/O (cancellation is sufficient, no cleanup needed)\n",
